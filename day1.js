HW Burger Solution
command line:
npm i [install dependencies]

- looks like you need to create a database
  - CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXXISTS burgers_db;

  but then get rid of the rest, keep USE burgers when you copy and paste other data bases info
  so it doesn't erase other database data

  -connecting to DATABASE
  -reading database
  - create data
  - updates DATABASE


  during the break:
  - learn handle bars...see will's articles he posted on slack...catch up on anything you're behind on
