Class Objectives
- Learn HTTP verbs: besides get and post
- Create mini App
- Use express and template engine

THE FOLLOWING ARE HTTP VERBS URL <--> URI
get: server goes and locates the resource, parses the body
post: when you want the server to act in a certain way. you give it a body to put what ever you want in it. create a resource on the server.
put: update. resource already exists on the server, so you might have to do a query to know that information
delete: it deletes a query on the server ??




rest: Representational State Transfer. how do we get resources from a web server?
we want it to be statements. ie. " I want to get user A."
that query doesn't change. it shouldnt return side affects.
It should return the same thing every time. Deals with URI. rest is an architecture
