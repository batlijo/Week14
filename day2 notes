Class Objectives
- Learn HTTP verbs: besides get and post
- Create mini App
- Use express and template engine

THE FOLLOWING ARE HTTP VERBS URL <--> URI
get: server goes and locates the resource, parses the body
post: when you want the server to act in a certain way. you give it a body to put what ever you want in it. create a resource on the server.
put: update. resource already exists on the server, so you might have to do a query to know that information
delete: it deletes a query on the server ??




rest: Representational State Transfer. how do we get resources from a web server?
we want it to be statements. ie. " I want to get user A."
that query doesn't change. it shouldnt return side affects.
It should return the same thing every time. Deals with URI. rest is an architecture.
An architectural style called REST (Representational State Transfer) advocates that web applications
should use HTTP as it was originally envisioned. Lookups should use GET requests. PUT, POST, and DELETE
requests should be used for mutation, creation, and deletion respectively.


We use HTTP, so we can put messages in the right order. It will attempt to keep getting data which is important.
